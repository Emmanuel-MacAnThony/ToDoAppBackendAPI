# ToDoAppBackendAPI
A full django mvc app . An API is also implemented
This is a Django ToDo App that implements basic CRUD functionality. The project was implemented using Django and Django Rest Framework.
Django MVC architecture was exploited to build a stand alone app. Also, an API was implemented for the project using Django Rest Framework.
The project runs on port 8000 of the local machine in the development phase. Any frontend consuming its API must be located on port 3000 of the local machine due to CORS considerations.
A Screenshot of the MVC standalone app is shown below
